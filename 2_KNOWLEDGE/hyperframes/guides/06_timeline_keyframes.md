# Timeline Editing

> What you can edit in the Studio timeline today, how those edits map back to HTML, and the current limitations.

The Studio timeline lets you edit the parts of a HyperFrames composition that can be persisted cleanly back into source HTML.

It is not a separate project format or hidden binary state. Every supported timeline action updates the same `data-*` attributes and inline styles that your composition already uses.

## What the Timeline Can Do

* **Move clips in time** — drag a clip horizontally to update `data-start`
* **Move clips between rows** — drag a clip vertically to update `data-track-index`
* **Change visual stacking** — top timeline rows render above lower rows, and that ordering is persisted back into inline `z-index`
* **Trim the end of a clip** — drag the right handle to reduce `data-duration`
* **Trim the start of media clips** — drag the left handle on clips backed by media offsets to advance the clip start and playback offset together

## How Timeline Edits Map To Source

The timeline works directly against your HTML:

* horizontal move updates `data-start`
* vertical move updates `data-track-index`
* right trim updates `data-duration`
* media left trim updates `data-start` and `data-media-start` or `data-playback-start`
* changing row order also updates inline `z-index` so the preview matches the timeline

This means timeline editing stays inspectable and versionable. If you open the file after a move or trim, you can see the exact attributes that changed.

## Current Editing Model By Clip Type

### Generic motion / DOM clips

Examples:

* `div`
* `section`
* `aside`
* GSAP-driven cards, overlays, and text blocks

Supported:

* move the clip later or earlier on the timeline
* move the clip to another row
* trim the end of the clip

Not supported yet:

* true front trim that removes the beginning of the animation itself

### Media clips

Examples:

* `video`
* `audio`
* wrappers backed by `data-media-start` / `data-playback-start`

Supported:

* move the clip later or earlier on the timeline
* move the clip to another row
* trim the end of the clip
* trim the start of the media content itself

## Why Start Trim Is Media-Only

Media clips have a real content-offset model:

* `data-media-start`
* `data-playback-start`

Those attributes let the Studio say:

> Start this clip later on the timeline, and also start reading the media later inside the source.

Generic motion clips do not have an equivalent playback-offset model yet. For a GSAP-driven `section` or `div`, the Studio can:

* move the whole clip later by changing `data-start`
* shorten its visible window by changing `data-duration`

But it cannot yet say:

> Start this animation halfway through its timeline.

That is why generic motion clips do **not** show an interactive left trim handle. The control is hidden instead of implying behavior the runtime cannot currently represent truthfully.

<Note>
  A useful mental model is: **move** changes when a clip starts, **right trim** changes when it ends, and **left trim** only appears when the clip can actually skip the beginning of its own content.
</Note>

## Stacking Rule

The Studio follows the normal timeline-editor convention:

* the visually top row renders on top
* lower rows render underneath

If you want captions, lower-thirds, or overlays to sit above other content, place them on a visually higher timeline row.

## Current Limitations

* **No true front trim for generic motion clips yet.**
  You can move those clips later in time, but you cannot start their internal animation phase partway through.
* **Layering is still driven by row order plus persisted inline `z-index`.**
  If a clip already has custom CSS stacking rules outside the Studio flow, keep that in mind when editing manually.
* **Timeline editing is intentionally scoped.**
  The Studio currently focuses on move and trim behavior. It does not yet expose full split, slip, slide, ripple, or roll editing semantics.

## Best Practices

* Use **move** when you want an element to start later but still play its full animation.
* Use **right trim** when you want the element to end sooner.
* Use **media left trim** when you want to remove the beginning of a video or audio clip.
* Put overlays and captions on visually higher rows so they render above base footage.

# Keyframes & Arc Motion

> Edit GSAP keyframes visually in Studio — timeline diamonds, arc motion paths, and gesture recording.

Studio gives you visual tools to create and edit GSAP keyframes without writing code. You can adjust animation properties in the Design Panel, convert straight-line motion into curved arcs, and record gesture-based motion by dragging elements in the preview.

## Timeline Keyframe Diamonds

When you open a composition in Studio, the timeline shows **diamond markers** on clips that have GSAP animations. Each diamond represents a keyframe — a point in time where a property value is set.

* **Start diamond** — where the tween begins (e.g., `x: 0`)
* **End diamond** — where the tween ends (e.g., `x: 1000`)
* Elements with multiple tweens show multiple diamond pairs

<Note>
  Keyframe diamonds are synthesized from your GSAP tweens automatically. Every `.to()`, `.from()`, and `.fromTo()` call produces start and end markers on the timeline.
</Note>

## Editing Animation Properties

Select any animated element in the preview or timeline to open the Design Panel. The **Animation** section shows:

* **Method badge** — `Animate`, `Animate In`, or `Animate Out` (maps to `.to()`, `.from()`, `.fromTo()`)
* **Timing** — Length (duration) and Starts at (position on timeline)
* **Speed** — The GSAP ease (e.g., `power2.inOut`, `back.out(3)`)
* **Speed curve** — Visual preview of the easing function
* **Properties** — Each animated property (Move X, Move Y, Scale, Opacity, etc.) with its target value

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an element">
    Click an animated element in the preview or its clip in the timeline. The Design Panel opens on the right.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit property values">
    Change any property value directly — for example, set Move X to `500` to make the element travel 500px. Changes apply immediately via soft reload.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change the ease">
    Click the ease dropdown (e.g., "Smooth ease") to pick a different easing function. The speed curve preview updates live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify in Code tab">
    Switch to the Code tab to see the generated GSAP code. Every Design Panel edit writes valid GSAP that renders identically in preview and headless export.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Arc Motion

Arc Motion converts a straight-line x/y animation into a curved path using GSAP's MotionPathPlugin. Instead of moving in a straight diagonal, the element follows a smooth arc — like tossing an object into a basket.

### When to Use It

Use Arc Motion when an element has both `x` and `y` properties in a single tween. Common examples:

* Add-to-cart animations (item arcs from product to cart icon)
* Throw/toss effects
* Any motion that should feel physical rather than robotic

### Step-by-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an element with x/y motion">
    The element must have a `.to()` tween with both Move X and Move Y properties. Select it in the preview or timeline.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Arc Motion ON">
    In the Animation section of the Design Panel, find the **Arc Motion** toggle below the property list. Switch it ON.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Curviness">
    The **Curviness** slider controls how exaggerated the arc is:

    * `0` — straight line (no curve)
    * `1` — gentle natural arc
    * `1.5–2.0` — smooth throw feel (recommended)
    * `3.0` — extreme loop

    Scrub the timeline to preview the arc in real time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Auto-Rotate (optional)">
    Enable **Auto-Rotate** to make the element rotate to face the direction of travel along the arc. This adds a "thrown" feel vs. a "floating" feel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the generated code">
    Switch to the Code tab. You'll see:

    ```javascript theme={null}
    tl.to("#element", {
      scale: 0.4,
      opacity: 0,
      duration: 1.0,
      ease: "power2.inOut",
      motionPath: {
        path: [{x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1400, y: -280}],
        curviness: 1.5,
        autoRotate: true
      }
    }, 1.0);
    ```

    The MotionPathPlugin CDN script is added automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable to restore straight motion">
    Toggle Arc Motion OFF to restore the original `x` and `y` properties as flat tween values.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Arc Motion works for flat `.to()` tweens with x/y properties. It synthesizes waypoints from `{x: 0, y: 0}` (start) to `{x: targetX, y: targetY}` (end). For more complex paths with intermediate waypoints, edit the `motionPath.path` array directly in the Code tab.
</Note>

## Gesture Recording

Record motion by physically dragging an element in the preview while the timeline plays. The pointer path is simplified and converted into GSAP keyframes automatically.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an element">
    Click the element you want to animate in the preview.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Record or press R">
    In the Animation section of the Design Panel, click **Record gesture (R)** or press the R key. The timeline starts playing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag the element">
    Move the element in the preview by dragging it. Your pointer motion is sampled at \~60fps. A trail overlay shows the path you're drawing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop recording">
    Press R again or wait for the timeline to reach the end. Recording stops, the motion is simplified (reducing \~180 raw samples to 5–15 clean keyframes), and the keyframes are written to the GSAP script immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review or undo">
    The timeline seeks back to the recording start so you can scrub through the result. If you don't like it, press **Cmd+Z** to undo and try again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Computed Timelines (Helpers, Loops, Dynamic Data)

Studio reads your timeline statically, so a composition that builds its tweens with a **helper function called several times**, a **bounded loop**, or **data-driven values** still shows every keyframe at its true time on the timeline — and the Arc Motion panel still activates for `motionPath` tweens, even when the path comes from a variable.

How those keyframes are **edited** depends on how they were authored:

* **Literal tweens** (`tl.to("#x", { x: 100 }, 1.3)`) — edit directly in the Design Panel. One source call, one tween.
* **Helper / loop tweens** — a single source line (e.g. `addCycle(1.0, ...)`) expands into many runtime tweens, so editing one keyframe is ambiguous. The Animation card shows a **"Generated by `addCycle()` — not directly editable"** notice with an **Unroll to edit** action: it rewrites the helper or loop into explicit literal tweens (a visual no-op — the render is identical), after which each keyframe edits directly. Undo restores the helper.
* **Computed-value tweens** (the rare case of a value derived at runtime that can't be resolved or unrolled) — stay display-only; edit them in the **Code tab**. HyperFrames compositions are deterministic, so this case is uncommon.

The notice on each computed tween tells you which path applies.

## Clipboard Context

The **clipboard icon** next to the element name in the Design Panel copies structured element context to your clipboard:

```
Element: Title (#title)
File: index.html:15
Position: x=100, y=40
Size: 264×43
Tag: <div>
Animation: from() 0.5s at 0s, ease: power2.out
Properties: x: -40, opacity: 0
```

Paste this into any AI agent prompt to give it spatial context about the element — its position, size, animation, and source location.
